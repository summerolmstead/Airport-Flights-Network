# Airport-Flights-Network
Visualization of source airport to target airport and frequency of flights represented visually as a network. 

First, we did a smaller network visualization of just the US major city airports.

Next, we did the full flight network visualization in REAL TIME. Therefore, you can see the graph updating itself every second to measure the new edges and things for every flight occuring in the world. Note: The full_flight_weighted.html file because of this takes forever to load.

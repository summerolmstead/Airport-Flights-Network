# Airport-Flights-Network
Visualization of source airport to target airport and frequency of flights represented visually as a network. 

First, we did a smaller network visualization of just the US major city airports.

Next, we did the full flight network visualization. Note: The full_flight.html file because of how much data is inside of it makes it take forever to load.
